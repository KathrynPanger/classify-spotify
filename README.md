# Genre-Classification-Algorithm

A machine learning project that converts songs into visualizations and extracts 6 different audio features per song. Features are used to create an algorithm to classify Spotify songs into ten different genres.

## Getting Started

* An extensive walkthrough of our code/dependencies/contributions can be found here: https://audio-recognition.herokuapp.com/
* We recommend viewing all ipynb files in google collab due to cross platform librosa support! 
* Be sure to upload "numerical_machine_data_FINAL.csv" to your google drive if you wish to run machine learning code
* Mount the drive to the correct directory within the "Deep_learning_model.ipynb" file before running
* WE DO NOT RECOMMEND RUNNING LIBROSA CODE! READ ONLY!!! (Unless you have 45 minutes or so to kill)

### Prerequisites

* Internet browser installed if you want to view the website or collab files!
